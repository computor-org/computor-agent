# Git credentials configuration for Computor Agent
#
# Copy this file to ~/.computor/credentials.yaml and update with your tokens.
# Make sure to set proper permissions: chmod 600 ~/.computor/credentials.yaml
#
# Scope is automatically inferred from the pattern:
#   - No path (e.g., https://gitlab.com) -> matches ALL repos on that host
#   - One path segment (e.g., https://gitlab.com/group) -> matches repos in that group
#   - Two+ segments (e.g., https://gitlab.com/group/repo) -> matches exact repository
#
# More specific patterns always take precedence over less specific ones.
